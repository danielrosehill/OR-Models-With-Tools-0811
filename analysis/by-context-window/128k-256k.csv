OpenAI: o1,openai/o1,openai,200000,15.0,60.0,"The latest and strongest model family from OpenAI, o1 is designed to spend more time thinking before responding. The o1 model series is trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to reason using chain of thought.   The o1 models are optimized for math, science, programming, and other STEM-related tasks. They consistently exhibit PhD-level accuracy on benchmarks in physics, chemistry, and biology. Learn more in the [launch announcement](https://openai.com/o1). "
Anthropic: Claude 3 Opus,anthropic/claude-3-opus,anthropic,200000,15.0,75.0,"Claude 3 Opus is Anthropic's most powerful model for highly complex tasks. It boasts top-level performance, intelligence, fluency, and understanding.  See the launch announcement and benchmark results [here](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family)  #multimodal"
OpenAI: o3 Pro,openai/o3-pro,openai,200000,20.0,80.0,The o-series of models are trained with reinforcement learning to think before they answer and perform complex reasoning. The o3-pro model uses more compute to think harder and provide consistently better answers.  Note that BYOK is required for this model. Set up here: https://openrouter.ai/settings/integrations
