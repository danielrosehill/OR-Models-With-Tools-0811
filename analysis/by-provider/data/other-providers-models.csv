Nous: Hermes 3 70B Instruct,nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-70b,nousresearch,65536,0.3,0.3,"Hermes 3 is a generalist language model with many improvements over [Hermes 2](/models/nousresearch/nous-hermes-2-mistral-7b-dpo), including advanced agentic capabilities, much better roleplaying, reasoning, multi-turn conversation, long context coherence, and improvements across the board.  Hermes 3 70B is a competitive, if not superior finetune of the [Llama-3.1 70B foundation model](/models/meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct), focused on aligning LLMs to the user, with powerful steering capabilities and control given to the end user.  The Hermes 3 series builds and expands on the Hermes 2 set of capabilities, including more powerful and reliable function calling and structured output capabilities, generalist assistant capabilities, and improved code generation skills."
Sao10k: Llama 3 Euryale 70B v2.1,sao10k/l3-euryale-70b,sao10k,8192,1.48,1.48,"Euryale 70B v2.1 is a model focused on creative roleplay from [Sao10k](https://ko-fi.com/sao10k).  - Better prompt adherence. - Better anatomy / spatial awareness. - Adapts much better to unique and custom formatting / reply formats. - Very creative, lots of unique swipes. - Is not restrictive during roleplays."
Microsoft: Phi-3 Mini 128K Instruct,microsoft/phi-3-mini-128k-instruct,microsoft,128000,0.1,0.1,"Phi-3 Mini is a powerful 3.8B parameter model designed for advanced language understanding, reasoning, and instruction following. Optimized through supervised fine-tuning and preference adjustments, it excels in tasks involving common sense, mathematics, logical reasoning, and code processing.  At time of release, Phi-3 Medium demonstrated state-of-the-art performance among lightweight models. This model is static, trained on an offline dataset with an October 2023 cutoff date."
Microsoft: Phi-3 Medium 128K Instruct,microsoft/phi-3-medium-128k-instruct,microsoft,128000,1.0,1.0,"Phi-3 128K Medium is a powerful 14-billion parameter model designed for advanced language understanding, reasoning, and instruction following. Optimized through supervised fine-tuning and preference adjustments, it excels in tasks involving common sense, mathematics, logical reasoning, and code processing.  At time of release, Phi-3 Medium demonstrated state-of-the-art performance among lightweight models. In the MMLU-Pro eval, the model even comes close to a Llama3 70B level of performance.  For 4k context length, try [Phi-3 Medium 4K](/models/microsoft/phi-3-medium-4k-instruct)."
